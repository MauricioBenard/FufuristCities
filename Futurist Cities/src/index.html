      <h2><p>How will Africa cope with booming urban populations?</p></h2>
      <img src="" alt="">
          <p>Tim Beighton at Rendeavour, <a href="#">"Africa's largest urban developer," </a> says their projects, which include Appolonia and King City in Ghana and Tatu City in Kenya, among others, provide a range of housing.</p>
          
      <p>The developer's projects are on the outskirts of cities. "Our benefits are scale: large mixed-use, mixed-income communities, and those are non-gated communities so they're quite open.</p>  
          
      <p>"Rendeavour acquires land on the edge of existing conurbations, next to cities and capital cities, that are usually deficient in infrastructure," Beighton comments.</p> 
       <p>Clearly, Africa's rapidly-expanding urban areas require improvement to basic infrastructure -- and the use of technology to leapfrog otherwise expensive developments; instead of building more parking spots, build more lift-automated smart car parks.</p>
          
       <p>The new, satellite cities are also a concept, and in the past few years actualized developments, promoted by governments and large corporations as a solution to the continent's housing deficit. Whether they deliver for the wider public remains to be seen.</p>
